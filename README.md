# Machine Learning  
This repository consists of projects made while learning the basics of machine/deep learning. The projects start with linear regression, and progress from there.  
# Tools used to learn machine learning:  
Started with reading an online book by Michael Nielsen called "Neural Networks and Deep Learning":
  * http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html  
  
This book goes through the history and basics of nerual networks and deep learning, while also focusing on the math behind the techniques. This book covers topics such as perceptrons, cost functions, activation functions, neural nets, regularization, back propagation, gradient descent, and other topics.  
  
The next source was the Andrew Ng course released in 2022 on machine learning.

Here is where linear and logistic regresion was taught, as well as machine learning.
